What is GitHub and GitHub Actions

GitHub is one of the largest development platforms in the world. It’s an enterprise-transforming, startup-launching, community driven, super secure, cloud-based platform (GitHub, 2023). GitHub is a software repository hosting platform, it helps developers to store, manage, and contribute to their own and others’ projects. It is a platform that facilitates the interaction of people who can view, contribute and store each other's work. It provides developers with an environment that encourages the improvement of code (Code Institute, 2023).

GitHub actions and yml files

YML files (or YAML files) in GiTHub are configuration files written in YAML. They are commonly used for defining structured data in a human-readable format. YAML files are used to define workflows for GitHub Actions, automating tasks like running tests, deploying apps, or sending notifications (ChatGPT, 2025).

In summary, YAML files in GitHub are mainly used for automation (GitHub Actions), container orchestration (Docker), and configurations. They help define structured data in a simple, readable format (ChatGPT, 2025).

How the application works

The application is tailored to help the user select what type of food they are to eat based on the time of day it is. Basically, the user is required to input what time of day it is e.g. Morning, afternoon, dinner and etc, then the application will advise the user on what food to eat. The application also has a reset button for when the user wants to clear their previous input and enter a new one.
